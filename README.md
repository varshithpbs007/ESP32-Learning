# ESP32 Learning Projects

This repository contains basic ESP32 firmware examples/experiments written using the Arduino framework ( DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1) in Arduino IDE

## Basic experiments
1. LED Blink (GPIO output, delay)
2. UART LED Control ( Serial communication)
3. Button Simulation as input to GPIO
4. Input-Decision-Output ( full_loop )
